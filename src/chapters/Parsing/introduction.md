# Introduction

Originally we all spoke the same tongue, united in a shared concern building the _Tower of Babel_. Aggreived at our hubris, God cast us down and forced us to use multiple languages to interact with each other. Thousands of years later we killed god with science. We analyzed all aspects of the human condition including linguistics and the structure of language.

Just like all languages, a computer language is language – it has a structure and it follows rules. Most natural languages spoken day-to-day may have flexible rules but they follow a general structure. Computer languages are fare more rigid however – they follow rules because they cannot process ambiguity – at best they can soft match strictly constrained patterns.

Since the invention of computers, people have been trying to use natural human language to command them. Being the limited machines they are we have had to constrain the scope of the algorithm used. We call this the _grammar_ and it defines the acceptable patterns of a language that the algorithm can process.
