# ACID

> In computer science, ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is
> a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data
> validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. In the context
> of databases, a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID
> properties (which can be perceived as a single logical operation on the
> data) is called a transaction.
